Task 2:
200 points
Build an app that can generate secure and customizable passwords, helping users maintain better password hygiene. The app should be able to:
Generate passwords of variable lengths.
Include or exclude symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters based
on user preferences.
Copy the generated password to the clipboard.
Provide a clean and responsive user interface.
Deliverables:
1. Flutter App UI
A slider to choose the password length (e.g., 8-32 characters)
Checkboxes/switches to toggle:
- Include uppercase letters.
Include lowercase letters.
Include numbers.
Include special characters.
A "Generate Password" button.
A text area to display the generated password.
A copy-to-clipboard button/icon.
2. Functionality Requirements:
Dynamically generate a password based on user-selected criteria
Handle edge cases like:
No criteria selected (show appropriate message or disable button)
Very short or very long lengths.
Use Flutter packages like flutter_clipboard or native clipboard for copying.
3. Code Quality
Use proper state management (setState, Provider, or Riverpod).
Modular code structure (widgets separated for readability).
Include comments and clean UI.
4. Bonus (Optional):
Dark mode toggle
Password strength indicator
Animated transitions (e.g., when password is generated or copied)


NOTE- You will be given partial points in each task if you have successfully implemented
some of the deliverables we have asked for.

For example if you were not able to do the copy paste functionality in the task 2 but
were able to implement the other functions then you might get 150 points depending on
how clean other features of your app are. 

Important Guidelines(for all the 3 tasks):f
} Task might seem difficult but its quite doable if you had seen the resourcesM
}  You don't have to complete all parts perfectly, but attempting more and
implementing useful features can increase your chances of scoring higher pointsM
}  Don’t worry if your app isn't fully finished; submitting something is better than
submitting nothingM
}  You are free to use any framework of your choice, such as Flutter, React Native,
or any other you’re comfortable withM
}  Avoid copying code from friends or anywhere as it can lead to plagiarism and
disqualification.
